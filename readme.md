I'm not going to go through the trouble to publish this, so [see here](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted) for the basics of loading an unpackaged Chrome extension.

There are surely more clever ways of doing this—I tried relatively positioning the matched elements instead of just blowing them away, but it proved too time-intensive and I rarely need whatever is in the header anyway and I have more pressing shit to be doing with my day—so feel free to fork this repository if you care enough to, I don't know why on earth you would.
